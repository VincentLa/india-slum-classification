# Machine Learing Projects for Economic Research in India
This repository contains work for a few projects involving using machine learning / computer vision to predict socioeconomic characteristics of places from satellite images. The work will primarily focus on India. There are a few possible ideas:

1. Classifying locations as slums or not slums from google earth images
2. Predicting crops planted and yields (at roughly the county level of aggregation)
3. Predicting rural income (of all villages) from detailed time series data on ~500 villages over many years. This would allow us to predict incomes in another 500,000 villages, which would be really really cool.

The `delhi` folder contains some work on classifying locations as slums or not slums from google earth images of Delhi, India.
